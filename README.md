# Steganography-tool
An image-based Steganography Tool for secure message hiding and extraction (windows version)
Steganography Tool: Image-Based Message Hiding and Detection System
2. Objective
The primary objective of the Steganography Tool is to provide a secure and user-friendly platform for embedding and extracting hidden messages within image files using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography technique. This tool enables covert communication while preserving the visual integrity of the original image.
3. Abstract
The Steganography Tool is a Windows-compatible software application that allows users to hide and extract secret messages within image files. The tool is designed with a modern graphical user interface (GUI) and supports various image formats such as PNG, JPEG, and BMP. Users can seamlessly embed text messages into images and later extract them without compromising image quality.
The tool also provides features like image preview, logs/history of embedded and detected messages, a status bar for real-time notifications, and theme switching between light and dark modes. This project emphasizes security and usability, making it ideal for covert data transmission and digital watermarking.
4. Methodology
4.1 Least Significant Bit (LSB) Technique
The tool uses the LSB method to embed and extract messages:
1.	Embedding Process:
o	Select an image and input a message.
o	Convert the message into binary format.
o	Modify the least significant bits of image pixels with message bits.
o	Save the altered image while preserving the original.
2.	Detection Process:
o	Select an image with an embedded message.
o	Extract the least significant bits from image pixels.
o	Decode and display the hidden message.
4.2 User Interface Workflow
1.	Dashboard: Provides access to embedding, detection, logs, and theme options.
2.	Embed Message: Users can select an image, input a message, and download the embedded image.
3.	Detect Message: Allows the extraction of hidden messages from steganographic images.
4.	History Log: Maintains a record of processed images and messages.
5.	Theme Toggle: Users can switch between light and dark modes.
6.	Help Tab: Provides user guidance on using the tool effectively.
5. Features
1.	Embed Message: Hide custom messages within images.
2.	Detect Message: Extract and display embedded messages.
3.	Image Preview: Visualize uploaded images within the interface.
4.	History Log: Track previous operations with time-stamped records.
5.	Custom Themes: Light and dark modes for improved user experience.
6.	Status Bar: Display real-time alerts for success and error notifications.
7.	Help Tab: User-friendly guide to assist with tool operations.
8.	Image Quality Control: Ensures no significant degradation in image quality.
6. Technologies Used
•	Programming Language: Python (Version 3.11 or later)
•	Libraries:
o	customtkinter (GUI framework for modern themes)
o	Pillow (Image manipulation)
o	os (File handling)
o	tkinter (Core GUI handling)
•	Operating System: Windows 10 or later
7. Outcome
The Steganography Tool successfully provides a comprehensive solution for hiding and extracting messages within image files while ensuring ease of use through an interactive GUI. This tool is suitable for secure communication, digital watermarking, and educational purposes.
8. Future Scope
1.	Enhanced Encryption: Implement additional encryption layers to further secure embedded messages.
2.	Multi-File Support: Expand support to other media formats (e.g., audio and video steganography).
3.	Cloud Integration: Enable cloud-based image storage and message retrieval.
4.	Advanced Image Analysis: Incorporate advanced detection methods to identify hidden data.
5.	Mobile Compatibility: Adapt the tool for mobile platforms (Android, iOS).
